    This procedure assumes the image is already processed.

    Given an Image object, this algorithm will calculate the pixel sums along the rows and the columns of the picture.
    The resulting intensity function is then segmented into sub sequences along the axis's by watching, when the
    function first exceeds a certain threshold and when it drops below it again.
    From these sequences along the axis all possible combinations(=areas on the picture) are computed. These areas are
    suspected to contain intensity maximums. In the last step the average of each area is checked against another
    threshold to remove false positives from the final result.
